# Time_series_analysis_Yen

There are 2 notebooks, regression_analysis and time_series_analysis, contained in this directory that use the Japanese Yen csv to forecast future Yen returns and analyze if there are trend, seasonality and noise components.  Conclusions are drawn throughout in markdown cells to answer questions about model quality, if the Yen is in a favorable buy or sell position based on price or volatility forecast, and commentary about the viability of this analysis and what else should be considered to improve decision making.
